# Time-Series-Forecasting-using-RNN
Forecasting  the temperature using previous days temperature using RNN.

## Dataset and evaluation
Daily minimum temperatures in melbourne from 1981 to 1990.
Training data is taken from 1981 to 1988 and testing data is taken from 1988 to 1990.
Evaluation was done using SimpleRNN,LSTM and GRU and mean absolute errors were compared.
